# Airbloc Token Contract
## Overview
A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol respectively, which is intended to automatically execute, control or document respectively legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract, of an agreement or of a negotiation
## Goal
In this project, we have used the [Airbloc](https://github.com/airbloc/token) protocol and have tried to briefly describe this protocol, and we have written an explanation about some of the contracts that have been used in this protocol. You can see our description in this [link](https://github.com/arman324/token/blob/master/Contract/OurDescription%20.pdf).
